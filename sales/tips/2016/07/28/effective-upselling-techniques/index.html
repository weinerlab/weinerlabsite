While it usually involves marketing more profitable services or products, it can be simply exposing the customer to other options that were perhaps not considered.</p> <p>In practice, large businesses usually combine upselling and cross-selling to maximize profit. In doing so, an organization must ensure that its relationship with the client is not disrupted.</p> <p><img src="https://unsplash.it/960/600?image=590" alt="Seaside City" /></p> <p>In restaurants and other similar settings, upselling is commonplace and an accepted form of business. In other businesses (e.g. car sales), the customer’s perception of the attempted upsell can be viewed negatively and impact the desired result.</p> <h2 id="why-should-you-upsell">Why should you upsell?</h2> <p>Upselling is a common practice for service providers that offer different service classes such as airlines (cf. Bohutinsky, 1990). According to “the journal of business and industrial marketing; written collaboratively by Michael J, Sheehan and Paul R, Prabhaker “It is five times more expensive to get a new customer as it is to hold onto a current one.” Selling to a new customer would mean having to start the sales process from the very beginning thus having to establish a new relationship with a different customer. This can be time consuming and often not very effective.</p> <p><img src="https://unsplash.it/960/600?image=1043" alt="Landscape" /></p> <h2 id="the-benefits">The benefits</h2> <p>Upselling to a customer that you have already built a rapport with, means that they are more likely to buy from you, listen to your suggestions and opinions and trust you. Selling to the same customer can lead to loyal customers and repeat sales. Upselling brings up the profit that the business makes and the value of the sale. However it is important to understand that although your main objective is to bring up revenue and increase the amount of the sale, a customers experience and their time with you influences future decisions that they make. An upsell can be beneficial to both the seller and the consumer if relevant products are being shown to the customer. For instance, if you had a strict budget of $20,000 for a car, you would not want to be sold a car for twice the amount.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upselling">source</a>: Wikipedia</p> </div> </div> </section> <section class="diagonal patterned"> <div class="container"> <h2>Author</h2> <ul class="image-grid"> <li><div class="circle-image"><img src="/weinerlabsite" alt=""/></div> <div class="details"> <div class="overflow"><a href="" class="name"></a></div> <div class="overflow"><div class="position"></div></div> <ul class="icons"> </ul> </div> <!-- </a> --> </li> </ul> </div> </section> <section class="diagonal alternate"> <div class="text-container"> <h2>Next post</h2> <div class="blog-post"> <h3><a href="/weinerlabsite/sales/2016/08/06/definition-of-sales/">Definition of sales</a></h3> <p class="post-details"> <span class="post-date"></span> </p> <div class="post-content"> <p>A person or organization expressing an interest in acquiring the offered item of value is referred to as a potential buyer, prospective customer or prospect. Buying and selling are understood to be two sides of the same “coin” or transaction. Both seller and buyer engage in a process of negotiation to consummate the exchange of values. The exchange, or selling, process has implied rules and identifiable stages.</p> <p><a href="/weinerlabsite/sales/2016/08/06/definition-of-sales/">Read More &rarr;</a></p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <footer class="diagonal"> <div class="container"> <div class="footer-columns"> <ul class="footer-links"> <li> <h2>Pages</h2> </li> <li> <a href="/weinerlabsite/" > Home </a> </li> <li> <a href="/weinerlabsite/portfolio/" > Portfolio </a> </li> <li> <a href="/weinerlabsite/blog/" > Blog </a> </li> <li> <a href="/weinerlabsite/about/" > About </a> </li> <li> <a href="/weinerlabsite/contact/" > Contact </a> </li> </ul> <ul class="footer-links"> <li> <h2>Social</h2> </li> <li> <a target="_blank" href="/weinerlabsite" class="facebook-icon"> Facebook </a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank" href="/weinerlabsite" class="twitter-icon"> <svg height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M22.46,6C21.69,6.35 20.86,6.58 20,6.69C20.88,6.16 21.56,5.32 21.88,4.31C21.05,4.81 20.13,5.16 19.16,5.36C18.37,4.5 17.26,4 16,4C13.65,4 11.73,5.92 11.73,8.29C11.73,8.63 11.77,8.96 11.84,9.27C8.28,9.09 5.11,7.38 3,4.79C2.63,5.42 2.42,6.16 2.42,6.94C2.42,8.43 3.17,9.75 4.33,10.5C3.62,10.5 2.96,10.3 2.38,10C2.38,10 2.38,10 2.38,10.03C2.38,12.11 3.86,13.85 5.82,14.24C5.46,14.34 5.08,14.39 4.69,14.39C4.42,14.39 4.15,14.36 3.89,14.31C4.43,16 6,17.26 7.89,17.29C6.43,18.45 4.58,19.13 2.56,19.13C2.22,19.13 1.88,19.11 1.54,19.07C3.44,20.29 5.7,21 8.12,21C16,21 20.33,14.46 20.33,8.79C20.33,8.6 20.33,8.42 20.32,8.23C21.16,7.63 21.88,6.87 22.46,6Z" /></svg> Twitter </a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank" href="/weinerlabsite" class="google-plus-icon"> Google+ </a> </li> <li> <a target="_blank" href="/weinerlabsite" class="linkedin-icon"> <svg height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M19,19H16V13.7A1.5,1.5 0 0,0 14.5,12.2A1.5,1.5 0 0,0 13,13.7V19H10V10H13V11.2C13.5,10.36 14.59,9.8 15.5,9.8A3.5,3.5 0 0,1 19,13.3M6.5,8.31C5.5,8.31 4.69,7.5 4.69,6.5A1.81,1.81 0 0,1 6.5,4.69C7.5,4.69 8.31,5.5 8.31,6.5A1.81,1.81 0 0,1 6.5,8.31M8,19H5V10H8M20,2H4C2.89,2 2,2.89 2,4V20A2,2 0 0,0 4,22H20A2,2 0 0,0 22,20V4C22,2.89 21.1,2 20,2Z" /></svg> LinkedIn </a> </li> </ul> <ul class="footer-links"> <li> <h2>Urban Ltd</h2> </li> <li>Bringing the best experiences to the web for you and your clients.</li> <li><a href="/weinerlabsite/feed.xml"> Subscribe with RSS</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="legal-line"> <p class="container"> &copy; 2018 Urban Ltd &bull; Template by <a href="http://cloudcannon.com/">CloudCannon</a> </p> </div> </footer> <script> document.getElementById("open-nav").onclick = function () { document.body.classList.toggle("nav-open"); return false; }; </script> </body> </html>
